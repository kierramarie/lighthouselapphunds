        <p>We are Lighthouse Lapphunds, a group of like minded women dedicated to being preservation breeders of this wonderful breed. This means we only breed fully health tested finnish lapphunds with low coefficients of inbreeding, and great temperaments. Lighthouse is entering its tenth year with this breed and our love for them ever increases. We have traveled to Canada, Scandinavia, France, Scotland, and even Estonia to obtain our breeding stock to ensure genetic diversity. We guarantee every one of our pups for any defects in health and temperament and gladly reimburse you if there is an issue, as well as offering a never ending guarantee to take back and care for any lappie during its life. Occasinally we have a young girl or boy who will be placed as an adult. They are placed and cherished as carefully as any puppy.</p>
        <br></br>
